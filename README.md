# 🎬 Movie Explorer

Movie Explorer is a JavaScript web application powered by [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/). It allows users to browse and search for movies in different categories, such as *Now Playing*, *Upcoming*, *Top Rated*, and *Popular*. The app dynamically fetches data and updates the UI without page refreshes.
